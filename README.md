# Project Title: Neural Network Model under Fully Homomorphic Encryption

## 📄 Description

This comprehensive code aims to create and evaluate a neural network model under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). The project focuses on optimizing the model for faster execution while maintaining reasonable accuracy. The key steps involve:

- Normalizing data
- Setting up and training the model
- Simulating FHE
- Pruning the model
- Evaluating performance at each stage

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Normalization**: Ensures that data is scaled appropriately for the model.
- **Model Setup and Training**: Builds and trains a neural network model.
- **FHE Simulation**: Simulates Fully Homomorphic Encryption to test the model's security.
- **Model Pruning**: Reduces the model size to enhance performance without significant loss in accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses the model's accuracy and execution speed at each stage.
