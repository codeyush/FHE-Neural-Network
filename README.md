# FHE-Neural-Network
This code builds and evaluates a neural network under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). It focuses on optimizing speed while maintaining accuracy. Steps include data normalization, model setup and training, FHE simulation, model pruning, and performance evaluation to ensure secure computations with minimal accuracy loss.
